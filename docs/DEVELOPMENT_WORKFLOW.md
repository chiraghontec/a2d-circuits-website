# A2D Circuits Development Workflow

## üéØ Team Development Guidelines

This document outlines our team's development workflow, best practices, and collaboration standards for the A2D Circuits website project.

## üå≥ Git Workflow

We follow a **Feature Branch Workflow** with the following branch structure:

### Branch Types

- **`main`** - Production-ready code, protected branch
- **`develop`** - Integration branch for features
- **`feature/*`** - New features (`feature/product-search`)
- **`bugfix/*`** - Bug fixes (`bugfix/header-mobile-menu`)
- **`hotfix/*`** - Urgent production fixes (`hotfix/security-patch`)
- **`docs/*`** - Documentation updates (`docs/readme-update`)

### Branch Naming Convention

```
feature/short-description
bugfix/issue-description
hotfix/urgent-fix-description
docs/documentation-update
```

Examples:
- `feature/contact-form-validation`
- `bugfix/mobile-navigation-overlay`
- `hotfix/broken-product-links`
- `docs/contributing-guidelines`

## üîÑ Development Process

### 1. Starting New Work

```bash
# Switch to main and pull latest changes
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Create and switch to new feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# Push branch to origin
git push -u origin feature/your-feature-name
```

### 2. Daily Development

```bash
# Make your changes
# ... edit files ...

# Stage and commit changes
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add product search functionality"

# Push changes regularly
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

### 3. Keeping Branch Updated

```bash
# Fetch latest changes
git fetch origin

# Rebase your branch on main
git rebase origin/main

# If conflicts, resolve them and continue
git rebase --continue

# Force push after rebase (be careful!)
git push --force-with-lease origin feature/your-feature-name
```

### 4. Creating Pull Request

1. **Push your final changes**
2. **Go to GitHub** and create a Pull Request
3. **Fill out the PR template** completely
4. **Request reviews** from team members
5. **Address feedback** and make necessary changes
6. **Merge** once approved

## üìù Commit Message Standards

We use [Conventional Commits](https://conventionalcommits.org/) for consistent commit messaging:

### Format

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

### Types

- **feat**: New feature
- **fix**: Bug fix
- **docs**: Documentation changes
- **style**: Code style changes (formatting, missing semi-colons, etc.)
- **refactor**: Code refactoring
- **test**: Adding or updating tests
- **chore**: Maintenance tasks, dependency updates

### Examples

```bash
# New feature
git commit -m "feat: add product search with filters"

# Bug fix
git commit -m "fix: resolve mobile menu not closing on route change"

# Documentation
git commit -m "docs: update README with deployment instructions"

# Styling
git commit -m "style: fix indentation in Header component"

# Refactoring
git commit -m "refactor: extract common button styles to utility class"

# Testing
git commit -m "test: add unit tests for contact form validation"

# Chore
git commit -m "chore: update dependencies to latest versions"
```

## üîç Code Review Guidelines

### For Authors

1. **Self-review** your code before submitting
2. **Write clear PR descriptions** using the template
3. **Keep PRs focused** and reasonably sized
4. **Add screenshots** for UI changes
5. **Test thoroughly** before submitting
6. **Respond to feedback** promptly and professionally

### For Reviewers

1. **Review promptly** (within 24 hours)
2. **Be constructive** and specific in feedback
3. **Check for**:
   - Code functionality and logic
   - Performance implications
   - Security considerations
   - Code style and consistency
   - Test coverage
4. **Approve** only when all concerns are addressed
5. **Provide examples** for suggested improvements

### Review Checklist

- [ ] Code follows project style guidelines
- [ ] No obvious bugs or logical errors
- [ ] Performance impact is acceptable
- [ ] Security best practices followed
- [ ] Proper error handling implemented
- [ ] Tests included for new functionality
- [ ] Documentation updated if needed
- [ ] UI changes tested on multiple devices

## üß™ Testing Strategy

### Types of Testing

1. **Unit Tests** - Individual function/component testing
2. **Integration Tests** - Component interaction testing
3. **E2E Tests** - Full user workflow testing
4. **Visual Regression Tests** - UI consistency testing

### Testing Commands

```bash
# Run all tests
npm run test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Run E2E tests
npm run test:e2e
```

### Writing Tests

- **Test user behavior**, not implementation details
- **Use descriptive test names** that explain the scenario
- **Follow AAA pattern**: Arrange, Act, Assert
- **Mock external dependencies** appropriately
- **Keep tests simple** and focused

## üöÄ Deployment Process

### Development Deployment

- **Automatic**: Every push to feature branches creates a preview deployment
- **URL**: `https://a2d-circuits-pr-123.vercel.app`
- **Purpose**: Review and testing

### Staging Deployment

- **Trigger**: Merge to `develop` branch
- **URL**: `https://staging.a2dcircuits.com`
- **Purpose**: Final testing before production

### Production Deployment

- **Trigger**: Merge to `main` branch
- **URL**: `https://a2dcircuits.com`
- **Process**: Automatic via CI/CD pipeline

## üìû Communication

### Daily Communication

- **Stand-ups**: Daily at 9:00 AM (optional async updates)
- **Slack**: `#a2d-website-dev` channel for quick questions
- **GitHub**: Use comments on PRs and issues for technical discussions

### Weekly Planning

- **Sprint Planning**: Mondays at 10:00 AM

- **Demo**: Fridays at 4:30 PM

### Emergency Communication

- **Hotfixes**: Immediate Slack notification
- **Production Issues**: Call team lead directly
- **Security Issues**: Email security@a2dcircuits.com

## üè∑Ô∏è Issue Management

### Issue Labels

- **Type**: `bug`, `feature`, `enhancement`, `documentation`
- **Priority**: `low`, `medium`, `high`, `critical`
- **Status**: `ready`, `in-progress`, `review`, `blocked`
- **Area**: `ui`, `backend`, `performance`, `security`

### Issue Workflow

3. **Assign** to team member or leave unassigned for grab
4. **Update Status** as work progresses
5. **Link PR** when creating pull request
6. **Close** when work is complete and merged

## üìä Performance Monitoring

- **Core Web Vitals**: LCP < 2.5s, FID < 100ms, CLS < 0.1
- **Bundle Size**: Monitor bundle growth
- **Build Times**: Keep build times under 2 minutes

### Monitoring Tools

- **Vercel Analytics**: Built-in performance monitoring
- **Google PageSpeed Insights**: Regular manual checks

## üîê Security Guidelines

### Code Security

- **Never commit** sensitive data (API keys, passwords)
- **Use environment variables** for configuration
- **Keep dependencies updated** and scan for vulnerabilities
- **Validate all inputs** from users and external sources

### Access Control
